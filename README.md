The Final Ecosystem Goods and Services (FEGS) Document Reader is a deep learning technology designed to accelerate the process of identifying
and prioritizing ecosystem services when existing information, in the form of written documents, is
available. https://shiny.epa.gov/FEGS_Document_Reader

The FEGS Document Reader classifies the relative frequency of ecosystem services terms in
documents uploaded by the user, and provides an assessment of:
i) the relative importance of different ecosystems mentioned in documents;
ii) the types of users, or beneficiaries, who use or care about those ecosystems; and
iii) the most relevant ecosystem services attributes important to those users.
The FEGS Document Reader is designed to work with the National Ecosystem Services Classification System
Plus (NESCS Plus) and the Final Ecosystem Goods and Services (FEGS Scoping Tool). These two tools rely
heavily on manual user input, including working directly with decision-makers and other organizational
representatives to identify, classify, and prioritize ecosystem services based on their relative importance
across different groups of stakeholders. 

The user guide (www/FEGSDR_UserGuide.pdf) provides an overview of the FEGS Document Reader, the foundational tools of NESCS Plus
and FEGS Scoping Tool, the keyword analysis approach, step-by-step guidance for using the R Shiny
Application, and example applications.
